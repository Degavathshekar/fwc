\begin{enumerate}
\item (a) If a line makes $60\degree$  and $45\degree$ angles with the positive directions of X-axis and z-axis respectively, then find the angle that it makes with the positive direction of y-axis. Hence, write the direction cosines of the line.
\item The Cartesian equation of a line AB is :       
\begin{center}
$\dfrac{2x-1}{12} = \dfrac{ y+2}{2} = \dfrac{z-3}{3}$.\\
\end{center}                                      
\item Find the directions cosines of a line parallel to line AB.
\item Find the direction cosines of a line whose cartesian equation is given as 3x + 1 = 6y - 2 = 1 - z.
\item A vector of magnitude 9 units in the direction ofthe vector $-2\hat{i} - \hat{j} + 2\hat{k}$ is \underline{\hspace{1cm}}
